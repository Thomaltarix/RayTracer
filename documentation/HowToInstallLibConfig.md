# How to install libconfig

## Introduction

Libconfig is a simple library for processing structured configuration files, like this one :

```cfg
# This is the configuration file
config = {
    version = 1;
    name = "libconfig";
    enabled = true;
    path = "/usr/local/bin";
    # Here's an array of objects
    nums = (
        { value = 1; },
        { value = 2; },
        { value = 3; }
    );
};
```

In this file, we have a configuration object with several fields, including a version number, a name, a boolean flag, a path, and an array of objects. The libconfig library provides a simple API for reading and writing configuration files in this format.

In this tutorial, we'll show you how to install libconfig on some operating systems.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, you'll need to have the administrative privileges to install software on your system.
